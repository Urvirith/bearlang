# bearlang
Simple Language based on Go and Rust for Embedded Systems / Operating Systems

Hopefully will take off and evolve,

Goals: No Hidden Memory Allocation - will not have Heap At Start No Null Pointers No Macros, No Preprocessor Memory Safety - Will Hopefully Look at Rust Destructor Model

Will incorperate datatypes for

Floats f32 f64

Integers i8 i16 i32 i64 i128

Unsigned Integers u8 u16 u32 u64 u128

Bool - u8 true or false

Arrays,

Structs

Enums

Unions (Will be tightly defined when complete)
